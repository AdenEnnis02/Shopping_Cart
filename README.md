# Overview

{My program creates a shopping cart that the user can then add and remove objects from, display the shopping carts items and the total price of the items in the cart and allows the user to exit when they are done.}

{I Wrote this software because it was an excellent way to cover many differrent areas of interest when I was learning to code in Java, for example: I was able to incorporate the use of classes and conditionals loops and variable to create something that I believe is very useful in the real world.}

# Development Environment

{I used Visual Studio Code to create my Java project and it was very cooperative for the developer making it very easy for me to get right to writing code.}

{Java is an object oriented programming language which gives the developer access to a lot of different features that are very nice to use such as classes and inheritance which promote reusable code. I used a couple libraries in my code just to add basic features such as a list.}

# Future Work

I would like to create a way for the user to sign into an account so that they can save their shopping cart if they are to leave it and want to come back to it.
